todo: impact spreading, how to identify successful impact?
also, unit_died subevent, destory bank if exists still
also, ignite ticks can miss! i think we will have to treat as a normal withdrawl
  dont update the tick amount, we wont get a tick to confirm. just need to withdraw from balance the expected tick amount, and call it a day
ignite ticks can be resisted! include resisted damage as part of withdrawl

overkill > 0 ( or 1?) could indicate death, if needed besiddes unit_died

gaining impact:
SPELL_AURA_APPLIED / SPELL_AURA_REFRESH : impact aura to player
SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS: impact aura to player again technically


spending impact:
SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS fire blast
SPELL_AURA_REMOVED Impact buff from player
SPELL_DAMAGE fire blast
SPELL_AURA_APPLIED impact stun to the target (may not happen if immune i guess? or DR?)
SPELL_AURA_REMOVED impact stun from the target (may not happen if immune i guess? or DR?)

spending impact miss:
SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS fire blast
SPELL_MISSED Impact stun/aura on the target i assume (or ALSO seems to be the impact spread thats missing the other targets nearby. could expect multiple of these if it misses on many targets..)
SPELL_AURA_REMOVED Impact buff from player
SPELL_DAMAGE fire blast

spending impact conclusion?:
SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS fire blast
SPELL_AURA_REMOVED Impact buff from player

gaining impact conclusion?:
SPELL_AURA_APPLIED / SPELL_AURA_REFRESH : impact aura to player (make sure this is the player one, not the stun aura applied to target)


ASSUMPTION:
when spreading ignite, it takes the impact targets ignite,
and applies the remaining un-ticked damage as a new 2-tick ignite.
ex:
1. 6105 fireball crit
	1.1 = .4*6105 = 1221*2
2. tick#1 for 1221
3. impact spread from a mob with
	3.1: a 3 tick ignite, that has already ticked twice
	3.2: each tick is 527, so only 527 is left in the bank after the 2nd tick
4. mob gets 1221 wiped out, and replaced with 527 / 2 = 263 for 2 ticks

QUESTIONS:
1. need to check what happens when fireblast crits with impact, does it affect the ignite?
  1a. NO, it spreads the ignite as it is at the time of the fireblast, before any further crits are considered.
  It will indeed refresh the ignite of the target, and add to it like any other crit, but that happens after impact spreads
  Its going to be important to snapshot the ignite bank of the target on impact spend,
    so that when the immediate fireblast crit goes to update the bank, its already been snap shotted for spreading calcs

1.1. I think i havent seen a scenario where the fireblast itself misses, does that still spread impact? i have only seen a scenario where the impact stun aura misses
  1.1a. going to ignore this for now, and just focus on tracking impact spends, only to determine if ignite applies/refreshes came from an impact.
  if the impact spread misses some targets, or it misses entirely, there shouldn't be apply/refresh events for the nearby mobs right?
  only concern is that an apply/refresh of ignite could have came from another ability, and we falsely attribute it to an impact spread
    (even though we can determine it missed, and surely is not the cause of the apply/refresh)
  with that said, this scenario can still happen even with perfect miss tracking. we need to rely on the time window (100ms?) to attribute apply/refresh to a previous impact spend


SOLUTION TO IMPACT TRACKING:
1. use a time delta: like 100ms
2. keep a stack of impact (and/or fireblast?) spends
3. check top of the stack if its within time delta for any aura applies/refreshes
4. if it is in range, assume the aura applies came from impact

IMPACT TRACKING potential issues:
1. what if i cast an aura, like Living Bomb, within 100ms of spending impact?
2. does it matter if impact falls of without being spent? maybe need a combo of impact and fireblast to track it (think rxjs zip)
  2a. yes, going to use `spending impact conclusion` above
3. again like above, how to track impact spends consistently?
  3.1 maybe another time delta, but smaller. like 10ms. and it has to be:
    SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS fire blast
    SPELL_AURA_REMOVED Impact buff from player
  3.2 what about misses? does it just miss the stun, or also the spread?
    3.2a. covered above in QUESTIONS
